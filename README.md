# LRU Cache Project

## Description
This project implements an LRU (Least Recently Used) Cache using Python. An LRU cache is a type of cache in which the least recently used items are discarded when the cache reaches its maximum capacity. It supports fast lookups, insertions, and deletions of key-value pairs.

## Features
- Implements an efficient data structure for the LRU Cache.
- Supports operations:
  - Insertion of key-value pairs.
  - Retrieval of values associated with keys.
  - Deletion of key-value pairs.
- Automatically manages cache eviction based on the LRU policy.
